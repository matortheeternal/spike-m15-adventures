        <h1>About Card Creator</h1>
        <p>Welcome to Card Creator. This website is an early proof of concept for a
           desktop application which will allow you to design trading cards.</p>

        <p>I built this website because I though Magic Set Editor was an amazing and
           useful piece of software, but I found the templating language to be unwieldy
           and the lack of certain features to be surprising. Not enjoying C++, I've
           opted to instead embark on the rather large project of making something new.
           Whether this will be successful or not remains to be seen. This spike is here
           to test the waters and see what I can make quickly and efficiently.</p>

        <p>If you need to contact me you can find me on discord at @mator.</p>
